# 2300FinalProject

This was a final project for our CS 2300 - Intro to Databases class. We created a way for students to share old tests and other studying materials (not a published product because this would surely break some rules). The front-end was created in React and the backend used MySQL.

Here is a video that accompanied our submission that explained how to get the project up and running: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMLfXjcPc_M&ab_channel=NickFuller
